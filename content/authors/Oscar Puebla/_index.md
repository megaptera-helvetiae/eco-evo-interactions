Oscar Puebla has traveled the same oceans as we do and it was a pleasant surprise when we found each other just across the street here in Bremen. Oscar has lived and worked for more than seven years in Panam√° where he studied the evolution and diversification of reef fishes. Some of his favorite critters are hamlets in coral reefs of the Caribbean Sea. Using whole genome sequencing data, his group is studying dispersal, adaptation, speciation, and adaptive radiation, and the implications of these processes for population management and conservation during global change.

We are happy that you are here and we really enjoy joint group meetings and brainstorming sessions with you!
