Cassie is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Microbiology and Plant Pathology at the University of California, Riverside in [Prof. Jason Stajich's group](http://lab.stajich.org/home/people/jason-stajich/). She works on a variety of genomic, metagenomic, and phylogenomic projects at the interface of both host (insects, amphibians, seaweed and seagrass) and microbe (bacteria, fungi) interactions. Her research interests range from sea to summit and encompass questions related to host-microbe interactions, host-microbiome coevolution, and marine fungi. Cassie is a National Microbiome Data Collective Champion of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data practices. She is heavily involved in outreach activities. You can listen to an interview of Cassie by Mushroom Revival [here](https://www.mushroomrevival.com/blogs/podcast/a-quick-look-at-marine-fungi).
