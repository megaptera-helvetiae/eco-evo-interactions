Many aspects of our daily work can be best shared with a quick photo or video. Therefore, we decided to join instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ecoevoint/

Carlotta took the lead and created an [instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/ecoevoint/) for our research group. Now we are trying to regularly share our special moments with you. Whether it is [diving in the mangroves](https://www.instagram.com/ecoevoint/) or [running our digital PCR instrument](https://www.instagram.com/ecoevoint/) for the first time. Research can be super exciting and we want to hold on to these moments of beauty and joy. Peer-reviewed publications are only the endproduct and they do not tell you about all the joy and pain we experienced along the way.
