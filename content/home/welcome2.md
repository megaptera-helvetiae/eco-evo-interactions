In the Eco-Evolutionary Interations Group, we study how the closure of the Isthmus of Panam√° affected the evolution of marine microbial symbioses. This natural experiment provides great insights into evolutionary processes of eukaryote and microbial adaptation and speciation. We use molecular genetic tools and combine them with experimental set-ups and biogeochemistry to learn how populations cope with environmental change.
